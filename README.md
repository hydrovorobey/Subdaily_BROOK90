*The model files contain:*
- BROOK90 physical lumped water balance model with a special focus on a detailed representation of vertical water and energy fluxes on subdaily scale within the atmosphere-plant-soil system at a single site
- Sample data from DE-Tha ICOS spruce forest station (Saxony, Germany) including site parameters and 2020-2024 pre-processed subdaily and daily forcing data

*Technical remarks*:
- model is running from *RUN_MODEL.R* file and does not require any extra installations
- framework is currently working in Global Environment, so all internal and output variables are stored there
